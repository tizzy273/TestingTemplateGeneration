##Testing Template Generation Based on Open Source Repositories Analysis
###My bachelor degree thesis project, a writing Junit Test tool

Studying in 16 Maven Projects the correlations between methods return type and their relative tests, we create rules for test creation.

**TestTemplateGenerator** taken as input a java classes directory, generates test suggestion for every declared method. It will be up to the developer to act as the oracle.

**TestRecognizer** tool to recognize Junit versions used in java test directory taken as input.

**TestParser** tool to analyse methods and their realative tests. It generates statistics of an entire project.
